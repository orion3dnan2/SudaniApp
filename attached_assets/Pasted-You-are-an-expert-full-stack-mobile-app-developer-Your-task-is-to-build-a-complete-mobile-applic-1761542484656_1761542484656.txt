You are an expert full-stack mobile app developer.
Your task is to build a complete **mobile application called "Bayt Al Sudani" (البيت السوداني)** — a marketplace and community platform that connects Sudanese users in Kuwait and GCC countries.

🔧 Choose one of the two stacks below based on developer readiness:
1. **Dart + Flutter 3.24** for a fully native cross-platform app (Android/iOS).
2. **React Native + Expo SDK 52** for a JS-based multi-platform app.

### 🧩 App Overview:
The app should allow:
- 🛍️ Users to browse, search, and buy from multiple **stores & restaurants**.
- 💼 Users to **find jobs, services, or classifieds**.
- 🧑‍💼 Merchants to **create and manage stores**, upload products with price, description, and images.
- 📦 Admin panel (in future phase) for analytics, moderation, and payments.
- 💬 Integration with **WhatsApp API** for chat/order confirmation.

### 🌍 Core Requirements:
- **Multi-language:** Arabic (default) + English switcher.
- **Modern UI:** Minimalistic, elegant, with warm Sudanese color palette (brown, gold, white, green accents).
- **Responsive layout:** Works perfectly on all screen sizes (mobile, tablet).
- **Firebase backend** (or Supabase if preferred) for:
  - Auth (email, phone, Google)
  - Database (Firestore / Supabase DB)
  - Storage (images, products, logos)
- **Clean architecture:** MVVM (if Flutter) or Redux Toolkit (if React Native).
- **Folder structure** organized by modules: `auth`, `stores`, `jobs`, `profile`, `chat`, `admin`.

### ⚙️ Key Features:
1. **Authentication flow** (Sign up / Sign in / Forgot password)
2. **Main home screen** with sections:
   - “Top Stores”
   - “Nearby Restaurants”
   - “Jobs for Sudanese”
   - “Trending Services”
3. **Store Details Page** (banner, products, contact, WhatsApp button)
4. **Product Page** (image carousel, price, add to favorites)
5. **Profile Page** (user info, settings, language switch)
6. **Add Store / Post Job / Post Ad** forms for merchants.
7. **Favorites & Recent Views**.
8. **Dark Mode support.**
9. **Google Maps API** integration for location & directions.
10. **Notifications** for order updates or new jobs.

### 💬 Design Expectations:
Use modern clean UI similar to Instagram + Talabat + Facebook Marketplace hybrid.
Ensure beautiful Arabic typography using Google Fonts (e.g., Cairo, Tajawal).
Use responsive grids, soft shadows, rounded corners, and animation transitions.

### 🔒 Security & Deployment:
- Use `.env` file for Firebase credentials and API keys.
- Prepare for Android & iOS builds.
- Add README.md explaining project structure, dependencies, and how to deploy.

Output:
- A full working starter app with modular screens, Firebase connection, and navigation ready.
- Clean, production-ready code that can be extended by other developers.
